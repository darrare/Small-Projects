        string phraseToConvert = "Chill Touch\r\nYou create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.\r\nIf you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nEldritch Blast\r\nA beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10+3r force damage.\r\nThe spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.\r\nWhen you hit a creature with this spell, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrostbite\r\nYou cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrestidigitation\r\nThis spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:\r\nYou create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.\r\nYou instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\r\nYou instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.\r\nYou chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.\r\nYou make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.\r\nYou create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.\r\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpare the Dying\r\nYou touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue Strike\r\nYou point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target's defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn't ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisguise Self\r\nYou make yourself--including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person--look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.\r\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\r\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\r\n\r\n\r\nSilent Image (requires a bit of fleece)\r\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\r\nYou can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.\r\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Blight\r\nNecromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\r\nIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.\r\nIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Blindness/Deafness\r\nYou can blind or deafen up to three foes. Choose up to three creatures that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Command\r\nYou speak a one-word command to up to three creatures you can see within range. The targets must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on their next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Fireball (requires a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\r\nA bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 9d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\nThe fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Hellish Rebuke (reaction)\r\nYou point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 5d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Misty Step\r\nBriefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Stinking Cloud (requires a rotten egg)\r\nYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.\r\nEach creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\r\nA moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.\r\n\r\n\r\n";
